Solve Advent of Code 2025 challenges using a new programming language each day.

See run.sh for how to run the code.

## December 1st : R
R is built for data analysis / data science making it super simple to read and transform the puzzle input. Solution to part 1 is nice. Solution to part 2 is boring.

## December 2nd : Python
As with R it is sumper simple to read and transform the puzzle input in Python. I like the solution to part 1 because it only checks 673 of 2160426 candidates. The solution to part 2 is slow and stupid.

## December 3rd : C++
Compared to R and Python it is a hassle to read and transform the puzzle input. There is nothing noteworthy in either solution.

## December 4th : Julia
I have zero experience with Julia outside playing with the REPL a few times. I struggled finding the right information/documentation, Both the REPL and the compiler are quite slow to start up, making it a bit anoying to work with compared to R and Python, and even to C++ that compiles fast for small programs. Aside from that, the REPL is quite nice and translating the math solution (filtering / iterated filtering) into code was pretty straightforward.

## December 5th : Haskell
Hardest so far. Many years since I wrote Haskell. Struggled a lot with IO. It seems the REPL is missing easy help for functions. The solutions are pretty straightforward. I like pattern matching but rarely use it in other languages, so it took a while to start thinking that way again. Not really happy with the solutions, seems like there are things that could be simpler.
